Weather 

## Project Description 

"Wea-ter" is an innovative tool that allows users to track the weather conditions of any city. With an intuitive and user-friendly interface, users can enter the desired city name and obtain detailed information about the current weather, including temperature and humidity.

The highlight of this project is the voice search functionality, which enables users to simply say the city name instead of typing it. This makes the experience even more convenient and accessible, especially for those who prefer to interact with technology through voice commands. With voice search, users can get instant weather information without the need to type, further simplifying the process.

The Wea-ter repository on GitHub is an open-source project, which means that the developer community can contribute improvements and additional features. Detailed documentation and provided code examples make it easy to understand how Wea-ter works and encourage collaboration.

If you are looking for an efficient and user-friendly tool to track the weather conditions of any city, Wea-ter is the perfect choice. Give it a try now and never be caught off guard by the weather again!
